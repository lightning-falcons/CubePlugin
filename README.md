# Simultaneous display of LIDAR local and global maps in VR

*CubePlugin is an Unreal Engine 5.0.3 project designed to simultaneously and faithfully display a global point cloud and a sequence of lidar point clouds in Virtual Reality (VR) or Simulated Virtual Reality (sVR). The sequence of lidar point clouds should smoothly evolve over time, such as by following the trajectory of the vehicle collecting the data, enabling the code to display the movement of any dynamic objects captred by the point cloud. Most typically, the point cloud would be generated using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR).
  *It accepts .las files for global point clouds
  *It accepts .csv files for odometry readings
  *It accepts .png files for images
  *User-friendly configuration file to change important simulation parameters such as sampling rate and playback speed without the need for re-building
  *User-friendly keyboard interface to interact with the program during runtime, for example, to switch into a bird's eye view
