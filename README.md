# Simultaneous display of LIDAR local and global maps in VR

Module under development to allow local maps to be superimposed on global maps with a specified position and orientation over time in Unreal Engine 5. The viewer follows the location of the local map origin (which is at the position of the LIDAR unit). The orientation is either matched to the head mounted display (HMD) or in the logged orientation (i.e directed as the LIDAR point cloud is).
